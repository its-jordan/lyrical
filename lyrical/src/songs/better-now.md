I've been spending too much time talking to cameras

I've been doing this so long, I don't remember why

I need a movement

I need a shakedown

I need a freefall

Ohhh, 'cause I'm dying

Yeah I'm

Barely alive but I'll

Give it a try, I've been

Livin' a lie, but I'm

Better now

Barely alive but I'll

Give it a try, I've been

Livin' a lie, but I'm

Better now

Barely alive but I'll

Give it a try, I've been

Livin' a lie, but I'm

Better now

Barely alive but I'll

Give it a try, I've been

Livin' a lie, but I'm

Better now

Well I know I've spent too much time just thinking 'bout what I don't know

Maybe there's a better place for me that I could call home

I need a movement

I need a switch-up, yeah

I need a pick-me-up

'Cause I've fallen

We don't have to go through these changes alone

We don't, no no no no

Spent my life moving up and down

Fighting fires all over town

I do the time but time's running out

But I know one thing

I'm better now

Barely alive but I'll

Give it a try, I've been

Livin' a lie, but I'm

Better now

Barely alive but I'll

Give it a try, I've been

Livin' a lie, but I'm

Barely alive but I'll

Give it a try, I've been

Livin' a lie, but I'm

Better now

Barely alive but I'll

Give it a try, I've been

Livin' a lie, but I'm

Better now
