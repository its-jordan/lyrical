With extra time I'd like to think I would've done this better

The fact I could ever fail never crossed my mind

Somewhere out there hear my demons screaming now or never

I think I just crossed that line

I'm kinda done with hanging out in bottle service

You confused me yeah you used me, but that's just as well

Hungry people try to break me, make me kinda nervous

Just goes to show that you never can tell

Does everybody live in a dreamland

Is this dreamland all that we know

Swallowing us up in an avalanche

And blurring these lines with smoke

They tell me that I should be a real man

But the only thing that I know

Is that I'll find my way out of this wasteland

'Cause this wasteland ain't home

With extra time I could have made up better words and letters

Pale shadows of my heroes help me rule the night

Somewhere out there hear my people screaming do it better

I'm just an echo of the things I like

I'm tired of never feeling like I'll serve a purpose

Snow on mirrors, future killers, yeah just be yourselves

Hungry people always stressing, guess it never surfaced

Just goes to show that you never can tell

Does everybody live in a dreamland

Is this dreamland all that we know

Swallowing us up in an avalanche

And blurring these lines with smoke

They tell me that I should be a real man

But the only thing that I know

Is that I'll find my way out of this wasteland

'Cause this wasteland ain't home

If I don't believe in all the old gods or the new

How am I supposed to find my way?

Searching the universe for something we can do

And living to fight another day and that's okay

We're falling from the top of the tree house

And no one cares if we go

I stumble over to a policeman

He says, "Son, you better get back home"

And everybody's laughing at me now

From their faces covered in snow

I'm trying to be the best I could be now

They say make it something we know

Does everybody live in a Dreamland

Is this Dreamland all that we know

Swallowing us up in an avalanche

And blurring these lines with smoke

They tell me that I should be a real man

But my pride will be the first thing to go

I gotta get out of this wasteland

'Cause this wasteland ain't home

Wasteland ain't home

Does everybody live in a Dreamland

Is this Dreamland all that we know

Swallowing us up in an avalanche

And blurring these lines with smoke

They tell me that I should be a real man

But the only thing that I know

Is that I'll find my way out of this wasteland

'Cause this wasteland ain't home
