Oh, yeah

Born slippy

So look busy

Young scumbag got the keys to the city

I'm knee jerkin'

Black coffee slurpin'

We're all screwed up

But the world's still turnin'

I hug my demons

I fistbump Jesus

I thank Poseidon for a sweet surf season

When I arrive it won't be pretty

From Moscow to the great Mississippi, so

I reckon in 21 seconds

I'm about to blow this thing straight to the heavens

Still stressin'

Still second guessing

Paid my price, but learnt no lesson

So cold, my heavyweight soul

So weighed down by the things that I know

And all told I got too bold

Heart of gold?

No, I do it like that

Like that

I do it like that

Like that

Boy, yeah

Space wizards

Hollywood blizzards

Cheatin' at cards

With Illuminati lizards

From Indiana out to Valhalla

They know my name

'Cause nobody does it better, yeah

And it's strange, but I don't mind

I drive off the edge of the earth to kill time

The storm's comin'

You better get runnin'

Wherever I am, I'm starting up something

I reckon in 21 seconds

I'm about to blow this thing straight to the heavens

Still stressin'

Still second guessing

Paid my price, but learnt no lesson

So cold, my heavyweight soul

So weighed down by the things that I know

And all told I got too bold

Heart of gold?

No, I do it like that

Like that

I do it like that

Like that

Boy, yeah

Like that

And if there are better days to come

I just hope to be there for some

And if there are better days to come

Who knows

You gotta chose your battles and make them mean something

Sing great songs, keep that heartbeat bumping

When all else fails, and you can't let go

A tin foil hat does more than you know

So cold, my heavyweight soul

So weighed down by the things that I know

All told, I got too bold

Heart of gold?

No, I do it like that

Like that

I do it like that

Like that

Like that

Like that

Paid my price, but I learnt no lesson

Like that

Like that

I do it like that
