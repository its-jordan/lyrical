There's nothing that needs to be said

We can pretend

We'll sandblast these walls and paint them again

When everything comes to an end

We can pretend

We'll sandblast these walls and paint them again

Oh, we hit a bump in the road again

And now we're working out just what it meant

I don't know much

But I know I'll last

That I'm falling fast

And I wont come back

You say that everything's been going wrong

But we've been living our lives how we want

It's a throw away cliche but we know

There's nothing that needs to be said

We can pretend

We'll sandblast these walls and paint them again

There's nothing left for us

When everything comes to an end

We can pretend

We'll sandblast these walls and paint them again

Ohhh

No I didn't think that it would be like this

So now i gotta work out what it is I missed

Now all this love

Is sticks and stones

Being thrown round homes

Breaking bones

What did I do wrong this time

I finally found a fault

There's nothing that needs to be said

We can pretend

We'll sandblast these walls and paint them again

There's nothing left for us

When everything comes to an end

We can pretend

We'll sandblast these walls and paint them again

Ohhh

There will be time for the changes we will make

If we rebuild we can make it better

I know it's hard for you to take

I'd give it time but I don't really care

I'm not the man that I was

I belong to the voice in my head, that tells me

"You are falling away from yourself

And from everyone else"

There's nothing that needs to be said

We can pretend

We'll sandblast these walls and paint them again

There's nothing left for us

When everything comes to an end

We can pretend

We'll sandblast these walls and paint them again

Ohhh
